<h2>Marking {{ app.name }} as {{ app.status_label }}</h2>

Submitting this form will mark this application as {{ app.status_label|lower }} and email the main applicant to let them know about this decision.
{% if app.status == c.ACCEPTED %}

        Because this application includes more than one panelist not already in our registration database and the submitter isn't already part of an existing group, a group will be created called "Panelists for {{ app.name }}".
